# mech-commerce

Mech Commerce. a game concept that is based from the mech war concepts. instead of machines doing battle on other planets on behalf of corporations, the mechs in Mech Commerce will do business with each other on other planets.

## the advance of yoga in humanity

because of the advance in yoga in humanity in this fictitious game solar system,
machines are made by corporations to handle all business commerce.
the result is that humans are better capable of doing yoga.

### utopian yoga fails

naturally the storyline of the game will lead to
a utopian failure of a yoga system based from
creating machines to do the work for humanity.

It turns out that doing work as an individual
instead of creating an automated process to do that work,
is the best form of practice of yoga.

### Alternate storyline continues in ayurproject-kubernetes

mech commerce repository was created as a prototype game. Simply by advancing
the theoretical implementation of mech commerce, and the practical
implementation of AyurProject in the Unreal Engine; mech commerce is coming
to a close and the mech commerce repository will be archived.

What was mech commerce will continue to exist as the baseline theory behind
ayurproject-kubernetes, a new repository of mine that will have a public and
open source face to it here on my eeshvardasikcm GitHub. The actual
ayurproject-kubernetes implementation and design remain private.

## Simple 3D graphics

- Textures on spheres and cubes
- Spheres make up the planet surface
- Cubes make up the mechs
