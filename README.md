# mech-commerce

Mech Commerce. a game concept that is based from the mech war concepts.
instead of machines doing battle on other planets on behalf of corporations,
the mechs in Mech Commerce will do business with each other on other planets.

## usage

Mech Commerce is made for one reason. AyurProject has potential to have a
mobile game version. The Seraphim Gateway 2 movie has the potential of having
3D animation. Mech Commerce is a prototype 3D mobile game. The only reason for
working on Mech Commerce is to advance my skills at developing in the Unreal
Engine.

### technical mechanics, graphics, audio, and music update limitations

Because Mech Commerce is only a prototype, there doesn't appear to be any
reason to update the game mechanics beyond the basic first implementation.
Graphics, audio and music can be updated regularly to make a better
presentation. Updating these visual and audio parts of the prototype is a good
way to increase my skills at creating games using the Unreal Engine. Game
mechanics can wait until after there is a specific gameplay model in mind for
the AyurProject game or the Seraphim Gateway 2 movie.

## the advance of yoga in humanity

because of the advance in yoga in humanity in this fictitious game solar system,
machines are made by corporations to handle all business commerce.
the result is that humans are better capable of doing yoga.

### utopian yoga fails

naturally the storyline of the game will lead to
a utopian failure of a yoga system based from
creating machines to do the work for humanity.

It turns out that doing work as an individual
instead of creating an automated process to do that work,
is the best form of practice of yoga.

### Alternate storyline continues in ayurproject-kubernetes

mech commerce repository was created as a prototype game. Simply by advancing
the theoretical implementation of mech commerce, and the practical
implementation of AyurProject in the Unreal Engine; mech commerce is coming
to a close and the mech commerce repository will be archived.

What was mech commerce will continue to exist as the baseline theory behind
ayurproject-kubernetes, a new repository of mine that will have a public and
open source face to it here on my eeshvardasikcm GitHub. The actual
ayurproject-kubernetes implementation and design remain private.

## Simple 3D graphics

- Textures on spheres and cubes
- Spheres make up the planet surface
- Cubes make up the mechs
