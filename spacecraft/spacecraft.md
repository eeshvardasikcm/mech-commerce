# spacecraft

the mechs use a spacecraft to reach
distant planets.

## the spacecraft is a large mech

the spacecraft is drawn using a square

### the spacecraft has multiple floors

using a flat surface,
the spacecraft can have multiple levels,
each level representing
one floor of the spacecraft

### storage

the main purpose of the spacecraft
is to store mechs.
the mechs are stored on multiple floors.

## Mech deployment

a mech is deployed from outer space.
the mech then enters the planets
biosphere and lands on the planet surface.

thrusters are not yet advanced enough,
to cause a smooth landing.

players will have to program the thrusters.
