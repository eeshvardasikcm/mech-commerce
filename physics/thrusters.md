# Thrusters

Mecha travels the planetary surface,
using thrusters.

## thruster positioning

thrusters are positioned on each corner.
three thrusters per each corner of the Mecha.
the Mecha is a cube.
a cube has three sides that connect on every corner.
each side will have a total of four thrusters.
there are 24 total thrusters.

## game controls

The game controls appear to be very difficult.

### difficult game controls

in order to navigate a Mecha manually,
The game controls will have to allow the user
to control each individual thruster.

the game will not calculate which thruster to burst,
based on the game, players desired movement objective.

The player will have to control each thruster.

### multiple input sources for gameplay

The Android device has multiple sources of input.
it's possible that the thrusters can be controlled,
using a combination of all of the Android's input possibilities.

### automated Mecha movement

automated movements is not very effective to start.
The game player will have to program automated movement.

macro creation is a good way to allow the player to start 
automated movement programming.

## macro style programming

same as with app and language I'm developing,
this Mecha game allows the user enter 
small amounts of information,
and that information is then
used to expand into boilerplate code.

### The Mechs are programmed to using custom language

the custom language that the mechas are programmed in
is the same language that I am creating.
