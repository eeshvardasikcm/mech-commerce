made up of spheres

## how to make a flat area on the surface?

idk.

## commercial financial charts have curves

maybe in the long term some curves can
concur through some system connecting
planet shape and some mech commerce in aop
financial figures.

the planet surface is made up of spheres,
or in some cases one large sphere.

## layering of spheres

spheres are layered to make the surface 
have different elevations.

### using the inside of a sphere mask

creating a mask and using the inside of a sphere,
should help Make the planetary surface more smooth.

### rigid details on spheres

spheres may have rigid details attached.
these rigid details should be small.
these rigid details should not alter
the overall shape of the spherical area.
